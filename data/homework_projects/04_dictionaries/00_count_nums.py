# ğŸ§  What You Learned:
# Lists: Used to store the numbers the user enters.

# Dictionaries: Used to keep track of how many times each number appears.

# Loops:

# while True: Keep asking until the user stops.

# for num in num_lst: Go through each number to count them.

# Conditionals: Check if a number is already counted or not.

# Input/Output: Taking input from users and showing results nicely.
