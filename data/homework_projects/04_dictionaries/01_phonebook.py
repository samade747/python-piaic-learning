# ðŸ§  What You Learned:
# Dictionaries are used to store key-value pairs like "Alice" : "123456789".

# The while True loops keep asking for input until you break with an empty string.

# You can check if a key exists in a dictionary with if name in phonebook.

# This small project brings together:

# input/output

# loops

# conditionals

# data structures
