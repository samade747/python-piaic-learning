# ðŸ§  What You Learned:
# Constants: MAX_LENGTH is a constant that controls how long the list is allowed to be.

# Loop with condition: while len(lst) > MAX_LENGTH keeps running as long as the list is too long.

# .pop(): Removes and returns the last element of the list.

# Modular code: get_lst() and shorten() are two functions with different jobsâ€”this is a clean way to build programs.
