# ðŸ§  What You Learned:
# random.randint(a, b): Generates a random number between a and b (including both).

# List: We use numbers = [] to store our results.

# for _ in range(N_NUMBERS): Runs the loop 10 times (you can use _ when you donâ€™t need the loop variable).

# .append(): Adds each random number to the list.
