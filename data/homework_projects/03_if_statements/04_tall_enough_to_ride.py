# ðŸ§  What You Learned:
# Constants: MINIMUM_HEIGHT is used to store the minimum height requirement.

# float(input(...)): Converts user input into a decimal number.

# if...else: Makes a decision based on whether the user's height meets the requirement.

# Comparison: >= checks if height is greater than or equal to the minimum.
