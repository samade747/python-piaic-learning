# üß† What You Learned About Leap Years:
# A year is a leap year if:

# It is divisible by 4

# Except when it's divisible by 100

# Unless it's also divisible by 400

# For example:

# 2000 ‚Üí ‚úÖ leap year (divisible by 400)

# 1900 ‚Üí ‚ùå not a leap year (divisible by 100 but not 400)

# 2024 ‚Üí ‚úÖ leap year (divisible by 4, not 100)
