def main():
    # This loop runs 20 times, with i going from 0 to 19
    for i in range(20):
        print(i * 2)  # Multiply each number by 2 and print the result


# This runs the main() function if the file is executed directly
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()



# ðŸ§  What You Learned:
# range(20) gives numbers from 0 to 19 (20 numbers total).

# for i in range(20) means the loop runs 20 times, with i changing each time.

# i * 2 doubles each number.

# print() shows the result on the screen.
