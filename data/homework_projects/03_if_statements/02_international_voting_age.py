# ðŸ§  What You Learned:
# Variables like PETURKSBOUIPO_AGE store age limits.

# input() gets data from the user, and we use int() to convert it from a string to a number.

# if statements let us check conditions, like whether the user is old enough.

# >= means "greater than or equal to."

# str() converts a number into text so we can combine it with strings in print().
